# Twitter Clone project

## Why did I decide to build a Twitter clone?
I simply considered it a good option to consolidate my acquired knowledge of React, plus it's complicated enough to start using a bit of Typescript.

The front end is built in Typescript (as a first serious contact let's say), React and Styled-Components library for styling.

....
I am currently working on it.

## Used technologies, tools... until this moment:
<ul>
    <li>React.js</li>
    <li>Styled-Components</li>
    <li>Typescript</li>
    <li>React Router</li>
    <li>Material Design Icons Library</li>
</ul>

I will use Firebase for the backend
