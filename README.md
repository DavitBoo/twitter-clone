# Twitter Clone project

## Why did I decide to build a Twitter clone?
I simply considered it a good option to consolidate my acquired knowledge of React, plus it's complicated enough to start using a bit of Typescript.

The front end is built in Typescript (as a first serious contact let's say), React and Styled-Components library for styling.

I am still working on, fixing it and learning about it. Because how I structered the project at the begging it has lots of features to fix and improve (let's say I didn't expect it to be that big), plus everyday I look at it there is something I would like to add to it. 
Also the aim of this project it is still to learn and to apply some new things I am learning, since it has lots of possibilities.

Since I am using still components and it has a nice amount of components and CSS, I used also to practice with the _CSS Stack Context_ and the _Layout Modes_ in order to understand it a bit better.
